    <ol>
        <li>Determine what this Javascript code will print out (without running it):
            <pre>
                x = 1;
                var a = 5;
                var b = 10;
                var c = function(a, b, c) {
                    var x = 10;
                    document.write(x);
                    document.write(a);
                    var f = function(a, b, c) {
                        b = a;
                        document.write(b);
                        b = c;
                        var x = 5;
                    }
                    f(a,b,c);
                    document.write(b);
                }
                c(8,9,10);
                document.write(b);
                document.write(x);
            </pre>

        <li>What is the difference between a method and function?
            <p>Method is a function when object is associated with it.</p>
            <p>Function : When no object is associated with it , it comes to function.</p>
        </li>
        <li>What does 'this' refer to when used in a Java method?
            <p>It refers to the object that contain the method</p>
        </li>
        <li>What does 'this' refer to when used in a JavaScript method?
            <p>It refers to the object that the method associated to</p>
        </li>
        <li>What does 'this' refer to when used in a JavaScript constructor function?
            <p>It refers to the newly created object</p>
        </li>
        <li>Assume object x is the prototype for object y in Javascript. Object x has a method f( ) containing keyword
            'this'.
            When f is called by x.f( ), what does 'this' refer to?
            <p>refer to object x</p>
        </li>
        <li>What is a free variable in JavaScript?
            <p>Free variables are simply the variables that are neither locally declared nor passed as parameter</p>
            <p>In javascript closures, those are simply the variables that the function takes (read and write) in the enclosing scope where is declared the closure or in a parent scope.</p>
        </li>
        <li>Create an object that has properties with name = "fred" and major="music" and a property that is a function
            that takes 2 numbers and returns the smallest of the two, or the square of the two if they are equal.
            <p>Answer:</p>
            <pre>
            let o = {
                name: 'fred',
                major: 'music',
                f: (n1, n2) => {
                    if (n1 > n2) return n2;
                    if (n2 > n1) return n1;
                    return n1 * n2;
                }
            };
            </pre>
            <script>
                let o = {
                    name: 'fred',
                    major: 'music',
                    f: (n1, n2) => {
                        if (n1 > n2) return n2;
                        if (n2 > n1) return n1;
                        return n1 * n2;
                    }
                };
            </script>

                }
                let e1 = new Employee("A", 1000, "Manager");

        <li>Write a Javascript function that takes any number of input arguments and returns the product of the

            <pre>

                var r = 1;
                let l = arguments.length;
                for (i = 0; i &lt; l; i++) {
                    r *= arguments[i];
                }
                return r;
            }

        <li>Write an arrow function that returns the maximum of its three input arguments.
            <p>Answer:</p>
            <pre>
            let findMax = () => {
                var i;
                var max = -Infinity;
                let l = Math.min(3,arguments.length);
                for (i = 0; i &lt; l; i++) {
                    if (arguments[i] > max) {
                        max = arguments[i];
                    }
                }
