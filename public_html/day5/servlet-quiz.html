                What is the difference between a web server and a web container?
                <p>Web Server or HTTP Server: A server which is capable of handling HTTP requests, sent by a client and respond back with a HTTP response.</p>
                <p>In Java: Web Container or Servlet Container: is used to manage the components like Servlets, JSP. It is a part of the web server.</p>

                What is a servlet?
                <p>A servlet is a Java class that extends the capabilities of
                    servers that host applications access by means of a
                    request-response programming model.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                How do web servers and web containers interact with servlets?
                <p>Web server receive the request, pass it to web container, web container create a servlet object if it's not exist, init then call servlet object service() method</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                Who creates request objects?
                <p>User's browser</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                What are the states in the servlet lifecycle?
                <p> Load
                    . Create
                    . Init
                    . Service
                    . Destroy</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                Who calls init and when? 
                <p>Servlet Container call init only once and complete before Container can call service</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                Which of init, service, and doGet should you override? 
                <p>doGet</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                In what sense are servlets multi-threaded?
                <p>service() is called for each request, each request runs in
                    a separate thread</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                What are the implications of this for servlet instance variables?
                <p>It means servlet object handle each request in a separate thread</p>
            </li>
